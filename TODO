ToDos/Dones:

- Encryption
- OP Code RC 0x35
  - Update node configuration struct to include `at_boot`
  - report config - for configuration updates from node to store, ACK'ed with SC
- JSON node configuration
- SS
  - bat_lvl
- MN 0x40
  - Message to node for time, routing information, etc.
  - Can be broadcast or targetted per node
- ACK's
  - specific packet number
 
Node
X pkt sequence numbers
X change ON opcode to transmit a SL_NodeCfgStruct packet
X ACK handling
X sign-on procedure
X replace RadioHead driver with native driver (sandeepmistry/arduino-LoRa)
- LoRa CAD
- make radio parameters configurable again
- provide method for store to force a node to ON again (node before store problem)
- ACK particular pkg_num
- Tests

Bridge:
- collect packet count info and provide via SS

Store: 
X track and report missing or packets
X new DB layer with continuous searchs for notification of web clients
X save Mesh/Node info in TinyDB yaml DB
- provide rc script
- provide git ci script
- provide an MDNS identity
- csearch access to payload fields

SteamLink:
- remove use of Node class from Packet class
- use Packet for standalone mqtt monitor

WebConsole:
- Timeline: Labels on x-axis need to be merged
- Table: headers
- Support older browsers
- static error page
- generic static page: 
- static assets
- YAML editor
- Higher contrast: accessibility colors
- Alert: clickable to the log
- Table: sorting and filtering
- Navbar hierarchy
- Timeline partial scrolls

Bugs:
fix: Adafruit MQTT library always sets 'retain' flag
fix: mqtt client sometimes hangs on a 2nd or later connection attempt
fix: asyncio_server Invalid session warnings from asyncio_server
fix: double ack needed from LoRa nodes

Future:
Query Language
